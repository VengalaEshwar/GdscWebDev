            <h3>Romen Reigns</h3>
            <p>For some, bearing the responsibility of one of wrestling's most storied families would break even the
                strongest Superstar. For Roman Reigns, it was just another day at the office. Or another day at The Head
                of the Table.

                The agile, imposing juggernaut has been told his entire life that he cannot accomplish his goals. And
                since day one of his arrival in WWE, he has proven his naysayers wrong in the language of broken bodies
                and shattered Superstars who thought they had his number.</p>

            <h3>John Cena</h3>
            <p>He’s a 16-time World Champion, New York Times best-selling author and record-setting Make-A-Wish granter.
                He’s released a hit album, starred in blockbuster movies and carried the torch for WWE since he first
                set foot in a WWE ring nearly two decades ago. If you really can’t see John Cena at this point, chances
                are you simply aren’t looking.

                Was there any doubt Cena would become the living legend he is today? You practically knew you were
                glimpsing the future “Face That Runs the Place” when a muscular Massachusetts kid threw down with Kurt
                Angle for a chance to become a true WWE Superstar. Sure enough, a little ruthless aggression went a long
                way. After gaining the respect of his peers by stepping to The Olympic Hero, Cena went supernova as the
                fire-spitting Doctor of Thuganomics, eventually reaching the peak by upending JBL for his first WWE
                Championship at WrestleMania 21.</p>

            <h3>Kane</h3>
            <p>At 7 feet tall and weighing in at more than 300 pounds, Kane is a monstrous abomination that seems to
                have been extracted directly from your childhood nightmares.

                Consumed by an infernal desire to set ablaze the lives of his fellow Superstars, Kane leaves a scorched
                path of destruction behind his fiery footsteps. Some of The Big Red Monster’s more demented acts have
                included setting a WWE Hall of Famer on fire, hitting a WWE executive with a Tombstone, kidnapping too
                many Superstars to mention and forcing Lita to marry him. No one is safe from his twisted desires and
                demonic impulses. Least of all, it would seem, Kane himself.</p>

                alt="" style="width: 100%" ; <h3>BigShow</h3>
            <p>Reminiscent of legendary goliaths like Andre the Giant, Big Show was a feared competitor who intimidated
                opponents with his size and stare alone.

                The World’s Largest Athlete’s measurements were astounding. He weighed 383 pounds, wore a 22 EEEEE size
                shoe and boasted a 64-inch chest. It’s no surprise, then, that his in-ring debut in 1995 left a
                crater-sized impression in WCW after he defeated Hulk Hogan for the WCW World Championship.

                From the moment he stomped into WWE in 1999, he ripped through the competition to amass a giant
                collection of titles, including the WWE Championship.</p>

            <h3>Logan Paul</h3>
            <p>Logan Paul a WWE Superstar? Nothing is ImPaulsible.

                The Media Megastar is no stranger to taking hold of the spotlight and filling it up with his IMPAULSIVE
                personality. Paul first got his start on the popular Vine app before transitioning to become one of the
                most influential YouTube creators in history. This transition paid dividends as Paul became one of the
                most-subscribed YouTubers with his channels having amassed over 5.8 billion views.

                In addition to being a social media personality, Paul has also dabbled in acting, appearing on
                “Bizaardvark” and starring in the movie “The Thinning.” He has also stepped inside the squared circle of
                boxing, drawing record pay-per-view buys for his bouts against fellow YouTuber KSI and legendary boxer
                Floyd Mayweather Jr.</p>

            <h3>BoogeyMan</h3>
            <p>Lock your door, check under the bed and pray you don't hear the ticking of his clock. If you do, be very
                afraid, because you're about to face your deepest fears — Boogeyman is coming to getcha!

                Hailing from a mysterious abyss known as The Bottomless Pit, the terrifying Boogeyman first appeared in
                WWE on SmackDown in 2005. Creeping around the locker room area, the bizarre Superstar would scare other
                competitors by appearing in the most unexpected places. It wasn't until Survivor Series that same year
                that Boogeyman would make his first appearance in the ring, assaulting Eric Bischoff to help SmackDown
                General Manager Teddy Long defeat the former Raw GM.

                Boogeyman continued to display shocking behavior in the weeks and months that followed. During a match
                with Simon Dean in December 2005, the freak pulled a handful of live worms out of his pocket and ate the
                slimy suckers right there in the center of the ring. From that night on, Boogeyman was rarely seen
                without a pile of night crawlers wriggling from his drooling maw.</p>
